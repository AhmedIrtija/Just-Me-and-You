                You are the most cutest and most beautiful soul I have ever met. <br>
                Thank you for popping into my life and making it so much better than I deserve. <br>
                I am always going to be grateful that you were brave enough to tell me "I think I like you" <br>
                I am so happy that I got to spend so much time with you and I can't wait to spend so much more in future. <br>
                Even with our ups and downs, we always come back to each other because we really care about each other. <br>
                You are an amazing person, you always think about others before yourself, you are so caring, you are so nice, you are literally perfect.<br>
                You light up my day, you make my night better, you sacrifice so much, you are the love of my life. <br>
                I will never know what I did to deserve you but I will make sure to always cherish you and give you what you deserve.<br>
                Thank you for dealing and being patient with me, it truly goes to show how much you love me even when I upset you. <br>
                Thank you for forgiving me, thank you for loving me all the time, I hope you can see from this small project how much I love you. <br>
                Thank you for existing and mainly existing in my life.<br>
